  <h3>Hour of Code is an organization that impacts millions of students in a variety of countries.Every hour of code exposes fundamental computing concepts.<h3>
  <h2> Why is this important?<h2>
  <h3> Hour of Code is important because it's skills are very important for modern learning. Coding calls for problem-solving. Nowadays problem solving is a skill that school don't necessarily focus on but so essential to the workforce that students will be a part of in the future. Problem Solving happens through all our day to day activities, such as losing a document, getting into a car accident, or someone getting your order wrong. These are just a few of many examples that affect people from their day to day lives. Coding also teaches students the importance of organization because of the amount of organization you need for other people to understand your code for you not to get confused which parts of the code go where and extc. Also organization comes in handy in the real world. For example, losing your documents, losing your car keys, and forgetting where you placed things. This is why Hour of Code is so important because it is preparing children for the future.<h3>
   <h2>How can I participate?<h2>
   <h3>You can participate in this worldwide event by inviting students to spend an hour of coding to familiarize all the students that are participating with all the skills that are involved and taught through coding. Invite students to come along and join the trip of the computer science education week. Make a quiet but cooperative place for the student to have some people help each other with their code and some people enjoy the quiet atmosphere for coding. <h3>
